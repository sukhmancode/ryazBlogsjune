    content: `Today, I officially began my journey with React Native! ðŸš€

Here's what I explored today:

- Set up the React Native development environment using Expo and the React Native CLI.
- Learned about basic core components: View, Text, and Image.
- Understood how these components render differently on iOS and Android.
- Set up debugging tools:
  - Used Chrome DevTools and React Native Debugger.
  - Inspected logs directly within Visual Studio Code.`,
